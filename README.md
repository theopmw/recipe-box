### Site Goals

This project is part of my [Code Institute](https://codeinstitute.net/) Full Stack Software Development Diploma, specifically for the **Data Centric Development** Module. The objective of this project is to "build a full-stack site that allows users to manage a common dataset about a particular domain" using **CRUD** operations - **C**reate, **R**ead, **U**pdate and **D**elete.

I love to cook and have various recipes all over the place (in folders or books around the kitchen, saved online, printed, in emails etc) most of which I have modified in some way. Creating this project is a great way to finally store all these recipes in one place in a way that can easily be shared with others or printed. It also allows other users to share and store recipes securely.

### User Stories

**As a user, I would like to:**

- [x] Access the site from mobile, tablet and desktop devices.

- [x] Easily log out of my profile
- [x] Receive feedback when I Log In/Log Out

- [x] Search recipes by ingredient, name or category
- [x] Add my own recipes
- [x] Edit my own recipes
- [x] Delete my own recipes
- [x] Be given feedback when I have added, edited, or deleted a recipe

- [x] Save recipes to my favourites
- [x] Remove/delete recipes from my favourites
- [x] Have simple instructions on how to add a recipe

**As an admin I would like to do all of the above and additionally:**

- [x] Access, edit and delete ALL recipes
- [x] Add, edit and delete ALL recipe categories

### Developer goals

* Allow only the owner of the recipe or an admin/superuser the ability to edit or delete a recipe.
* Provide users with the ability to filter recipies by category.
* Provide users with the ability to search recipes by name or ingredient.
* Further develop understanding of Python, Flask, Jinja & MongoDB (non-relational database).
* Improve knowledge of HTML, CSS & JavaScript.
* Use Materialize CSS to develop a website.
* Use Heroku to deploy the app.
