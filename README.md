# Recipe Box

Hungry? [Recipe Box]() has you covered! 

## **Site Goals**
---

This project is part of my [Code Institute](https://codeinstitute.net/) Full Stack Software Development Diploma, specifically for the **Data Centric Development** Module. The objective of this project is to "build a full-stack site that allows users to manage a common dataset about a particular domain" using **CRUD** operations - **C**reate, **R**ead, **U**pdate and **D**elete.

I love to cook and have various recipes all over the place (in folders or books around the kitchen, saved online, printed, in emails etc) most of which I have modified in some way. Creating this project is a great way to finally store all these recipes in one place in a way that can easily be shared with others. It also allows other users to share and store recipes securely.

The site has been designed to be mobile first and easily accessible and responsive on a range of devices. This is to allow users to easily look up recipes on any device, wherever they are.

If the site is successful and generates interest and traffic, there is scope to substantially increase the scale of the site, it is anticipated that the site could be expanded to include the following features:

- Add a way for users to like/favourite a recipe, which will then save it to their profile page
- Add a way for users to rate recipes, with a star rating system
- Add a way for users to be able to comment on recipes
- Add ability for users to generate an easily printable version of a recipe
- Add a way for users to easily be able to share recipes on social media or via email

- [x] Delete my own recipes
- [x] Be given feedback when I have added, edited, or deleted a recipe
- [x] Have easy access to the recipes I have personally submitted

**As an admin I would like to do all of the above and additionally:**

- [x] Access, edit and delete ALL recipes

### Developer goals

* Create a easy to use, online cookbook where users can utilise CRUD (Create, Read, Update, Delete) functionality to  post, view, edit and delete recipies
* Allow only the owner of the recipe or an admin/superuser the ability to edit or delete a recipe.
* Provide users with the ability to search recipes by name, ingredient or tag.
* Further develop understanding of Python, Flask, Jinja & MongoDB (non-relational database).
* Improve knowledge of HTML, CSS & JavaScript.
* Use Materialize CSS to develop a website.
* Use Heroku to deploy the app.
